# Multi-Clip2
Simple Multiple Clipboard Utility

Implements a basic text and image 5 pane clipboard.  

Doesn't support complex clipboard contents
- so using it for someting cut from excel or word will loose all formatting but will keep the text content (like pasting into notepad).

Each of the 5 clipboards can hold image and text data - and can be switched between image and text mode.

A useful extension would be to save and restore sets of content.
